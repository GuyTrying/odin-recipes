    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p><em>The Odin Project; first project.</em> In thus project I will be showing off different foods and how to make them.
            I will try my best to be excessive because I only get lazier over time. There will be a total of <strong>five</strong> 
            foods on this website</p>
